# 22.11.20 WirtBot version 1.5


With version 1.5 many things changed on the Interface codebase and the System-Tests.

Instead of relying on [nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org/), the System-Tests are now written in NodeJS - leveraging the amazing [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to interact with browsers. 

This major rewrite and the refactoring in the Interface lead to a few bugs being squashed and all use cases of the WirtBot Interface being tested from End to End.

The reason for the **nightwatch** to **playwright** change were tests of input validity. 
While there seemed no straight forward way to achieve it in **nightwatch**, it became `page.$eval(element-selector, e => e.validity.valid)` with **playwright**.


One other change happened on the installer. The binary name is now changed to `wirtbot-installer` and it will look for a `wirtbot-installer.config.json` json. So rename your old `wirt-installer.config.json` if you have one for your WirtBot.
